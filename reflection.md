**What were you supposed to learn/accomplish?**

We were supposed to create a program to display ASCII art.

**What steps were followed and what techniques did you use to solve the problem?**

First I read the readme file, then I thought about how to tackle the problem, which actions to define as their own functions, etc,
Then I created my designs, wrote the algorithm, and coded and tested the program.

**What were the Key concepts explored?**

Error checking, decision-making, looping, implementing and designing functions. 

**Did your results match what you expected to get?**

Yes. The program does what I intended for it to do. 

**Did you try using various test cases, or extreme test cases?**

Yes. I put error checking for every user input so the code will not break from an extreme input.

**What challenges did you encounter?**

I struggled a bit with the formatting of print statements for my custom designs

**How did you follow the first 3 rules of programming?**

1. Think before Programming: I read the read me file and completed the algorithm before starting to program.
2. Program is the embodiment of the algorithm: My code follows the algorithm
3. Improve through practice: By completing this PA, I improved my algorithm, function defining, and overall programming skills. 

**Did you overcome them, and how?**

Yes. I checked the Zy-books homework which helped a lot.

**Any key takeaways?**

Planning out which functions to create is really helpful in planning out your algorithm

**Do you think you learned what you were supposed to learn for this lab?**

Yes I do. I feel much more confident defining and programming functions. 

**What was it like working by yourself?**

Good! It was hard to not have someone to bounce off of but I also didn't have to spend as much time planning as I have to with a partner
